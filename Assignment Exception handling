##Write a function to compute 5/0 and use try/except to catch the exceptions.

##solution(we can give input a=5 and b=0)

def division():
    try:
        a=int(input("a="))
        b=int(input("b="))
        c=a/b
        print(c)
    except:
        print('this is not divisible')
        
 
##Implement a Python program to generate all sentences where subject is in
["Americans", "Indians"] and verb is in ["Play", "watch"] and the object is in
["Baseball","cricket"].
Hint: Subject,Verb and Object should be declared in the program as shown below.

##Solution

subjects=['Americans','Indians']
verbs=['Play','Watch']
objects=['Baseball','Cricket']

sentence=[(a+' '+b+" "+c) for a in subjects for b in verbs for c in objects]
for words in sentence:
    print(words)
